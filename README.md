For making Multiple Inline Insert data example, we have use HTML5 Contenteditable attribute in table cell for add multiple Item information. By using jQuery code we can append number of blank table row into Item Add table. So at once We can enter multiple item data in the editable table cell and then after we can store those multiple data into mysql database on single clicking of a button. So by using this feature we can enter multiple inline table data insert into mysql table in a single click. For sending data from table to PHP script we have use JQuery for fetching data from table cell and by using Ajax we have send that data to php script and in PHP script make multiple insert query and execute query. So in single click of button we can Insert Multiple Inline data into table without refresh of web page.
